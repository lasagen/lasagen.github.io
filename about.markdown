I'm a software engineer who likes, among other things, Linux, hacking, natural language processing, math, Meshtastic, medical devices, learning new stuff, and dancing.

I went to [Olin College](https://olin.edu/).

I wouldn't have gotten anywhere without having started reading [Julia Evans](https://jvns.ca/)' blog posts on the bus in high school.
